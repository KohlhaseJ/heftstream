# HEFT-Stream
## Heterogenous Ensemble For Feature Drifts in Data Streams

HEFT-Stream is an ensmemble learning method that incorporates feature selection into a heterogeneous ensemble to adapt to different types of concept drifts. This implementation is based on the algorithm originally proposed by Nguyen et al [1]. It is implemented as an extension of the python machine learning framework for stream data scikit-multiflow [2].
